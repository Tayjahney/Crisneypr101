# Security Policy
To maintain a secured parties request. all relent signs, symbols and processes are enacted.
if there ever is a security problem with the surety because of misleading forturenates
or slower response times between the supposed then .
the promiser must initiate the bond with a "key jingle"
if the guarantor is unable to provide the key jingle then a "cough remix" becomes the most relevant communication without a "splert/thought" signale to the surer.
once the surety receives the "truth statement affirmation" then the motion to secure the "pearl door" begins.
if, by any chance the security policy has been breached by unknown entities or "solid rings" all parties must "break"

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Most recognized vulnerabilities in the context come from the "d route". and not many from "v route"
to ensure a equally and fair opportunity and "associated course" through "p4pbooking"
reporting a vunerability should be an unretractable concourse and motion activated  
the most usual will be with a "swing arm" or "hard close" but usually when there is a hard close the vunerability is shut or unavailable
so to reestablish a "v route relink" the most obvious value statement occurs.
but, only can the "p4p" vunerability be a direct source and inform the surety and promiser alike one time and that time being at the best availability of momentum.

if a vunerability for either recognized party is declined because of possible unsecure "aspects" the decliner does only one "headright or headleft" depending on thier"feary"
if a vunerability for either recognized party is declined because of misleading "forturenates" a "giglee" would occure through both parties to ensure a culture of "plus-reconition" but neither is obligated and the same effect/affect is perfected.
or a vunerability can be a simple "relink" because of perfected effect/affect.


Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.
